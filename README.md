## Guillaume's Logic Simulator 

I've made a logic simulator once in C#, with SFML.net and it was a lot of fun. I want to do that project again, but in a little bit more advanced.

I don't recommend actually using this software, I'm just doing it for fun/to learn things.

This projects uses SFML and ImGui.

### Older project

I've done a very simple logic simulator a long time ago : https://github.com/Guigui220D/LogicCircuitSim
